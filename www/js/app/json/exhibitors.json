This area is poorly represented in online by the major players - Linkedin, job boards - because of the specific dynamic of the sector. <br />\r\nCeevee was planned as a mobile service first, addressing these specifics of the target market - no full length CV&#039;s, quick application and hiring, moving rapidly from job to job and of course the geolocal factor. <br />\r\nThe typical Ceevee candidate rather owns smartphones then computers with internet connection, she is interested in a job/gig in the neighbourhood, rarely see&#039;s the job as a career and changes them easily. The Ceevee employer looks for quick hiring, needs to fill a position from one day to another, doesn&#039;t advertise through the traditional channels like job boards, makes the decision about hiring on the spot."

It was the fanzine and mail-order age. I was obsessed to know which titles were the most collected and by whom. So we set out to re-imagine collecting, making it easier and more fun.

They now assign their asian subcontractors to create innovative products for them. Asian Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) are innovative in high volume production, manufacturing process and cost reduction, but are less focused on new product functionality and usage development. This role sharing opens business opportunities for companies such as SDS.<br />\r\nOur customers sell, industrialize or look for unique computers allowing them to stand out in a highly competitive market. They are French and international actors such as Orange, Atrust, HP, Samsung, GrosBill-Auchan and CEA. Our turnover is based on technology license sales, joint consulting services, parts and end products.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur value proposition<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1 - Our location is an asset for our international customers: we know what western countries consumers expect unlike our Asian competitors. In addition, partnering with western companies gives us access to state of the art technologies which are currently untapped by the computer industry (nuclear, aeronautics...).<br />\r\n2 - In contrast to our competitors rather centered on cost-reduction, we first focus our research on new uses, and then the technologies to implement.<br />\r\n3 - Finally, SDS owns a manufacturing and assembly activity. Mastering our innovation production is, for us, a major competitive benefit for our customers, looking for key-ready solutions. It allows a better understanding of the necessary development for improving cost and reliability of a new technology."
